# Payroll Tracker

## Description

This repository was made for the purpose of adding javascript functions to an existing page.  The added functions enable collection of employee names and salaries, output of the average salary, and selection of a random employee to win a drawing.  The code is designed to only accept a number for the salary, as well as to not add incomplete data.
